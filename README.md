This report is prepared for vehicle marketplace Crankshaft List. The goal is to determine various vehicles' characteristics, such as age, mileage, condition, transmission type, and color influence the price, based on the data collected over the last few years.

The report includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and relational descriptive analytics of price and various vehicle's characteristics.

The conclusions reached in this report are the following:
- On average, the older a vehicle's age and the higher the mileage, the lower the price;
- The better the condition of a vehicle, the higher the price;
- Certain models are slower to sell, e.g. BMW X5 and Ford F-350 SD;
- The rest of the characteristics are not a definitive indication of a vehicles' price.
